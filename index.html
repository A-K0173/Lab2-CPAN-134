            <h2>The Best Shark Tank Pitch</h2>
            <p>One of the best Shark Tank pitches is for a company called <em>TheMagic5.</em>
                <br>They create custom fitted swimming googles, tailored specifically for the person who ordered them.
                <br>Here is a list of reasons why this was such a good pitch in Shark Tank.
            </p>
            <ol>
                <li>The founders, Rasmus Barfred and Bo Haaber, had a clear vision for their company.
                    <br>This allowed them to clearly show the sharks they had a solution to a real problem, and they had the marketing down.
                </li>
                <li>The founders were also passionate about their product.
                    <br>This made the sharks more interested in potentially investing into their company.
                </li>
                <li>The Sharks saw potential in the product to be a huge success.
                    <br> This is why the Sharks started to counter eachother's offers becausr they all wanted to invest into the company.
                </li>
            </ol>

            <h2>The Worst Shark Tank Pitch</h2>
            <p>One of the worst Shark Tank pitches is unfortunately for a company called <em>PDX Pet Design.</em>
                    <br>The founders, Tara and Jason, asked for $300,000 for 15% of their company, and only had two main products.
                <br>Here is a list of reasons why this pitch didn't work out for them.
            </p>
            <ol>
                <li>The sharks were not impressed by the pitch. Lori, Mark and Robert all passed on the deal.
                    <br>Mr. Wonderful actually offered to invest, but it was $50,000 for %20, which was turned down by the founders.
                </li>
                <li>The founders asked for too much money.
                    <br>They asked $300,000 for 15% of their company which the sharks found was too high.
                </li>
                <li>The founders didn't have a strong business plan. They didn't have a clear plan and their products were unfortunately not unique enough and were lacking.
                    <br>In addition to this, the sharks were pretty disgusted by the "Licky Brush" anyway, which further led to them not being able to survive in the Shark Tank.
                </li>
            </ol>
